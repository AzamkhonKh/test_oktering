## Hi there

I have done the test task;

to run this project you should:

1. copy .env.example to .env and set "DOCKER_%" variables
2. `docker compose up -d`
3. run `composer install` inside app container
4. in /request-docs  route you should see api documentation

i was too lazy to create service and unit tests but hope you will image I have created them :)
